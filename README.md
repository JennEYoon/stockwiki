Development repo for stockwiki.us content and website
### Author: Jennifer E Yoon   
### October 4, 2025 start project  

Incorporated StockWiki Inc in California in 2008. Since then kept domain name StockWiki.com. Lost domain this July when I failed to auto renew. Rebuy StockWiki.us because it is cheaper annual fee. Plus Stockwiki.com is now selling for $5000 one time fee from Domain Registrars.  

As of October 2025, I now have the technology and sskill to develop this business by myself. I no longer need to depend on Bill and hired Developers. I can do it all with AI
